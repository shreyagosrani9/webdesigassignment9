                  A commitment to the principles of academic integrity is
                  essential to the mission of Northeastern University. The
                  promotion of independent and original scholarship ensures that
                  students derive the most from their educational experience and
                  their pursuit of knowledge. Academic dishonesty violates the
                  most fundamental values of an intellectual community and
                  undermines the achievements of the entire University.
